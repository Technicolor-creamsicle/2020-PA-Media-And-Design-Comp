[Sample Name]
pH Levels:
  pH Level: ()
  The pH levels for this water sample are (not) within an acceptable range.
  
  pH Levels of water are generally okay to use if it is between 6 and 8 pH.
  Please note that the pH of the water alone does not mean it is safe to drink, just to test the acidity of the water.
  
Hardness levels:
  Hardness level: ()
  The hardness levels for the water sample are (not) within an accepted range.
  
  Hardness is a measure of Calcium Carbonate in the water.
  It is generally recorded in ppm for Calcium Carbonate and also in mg/L.
  While Hardness is not a health threat, it should be taken under consideration when chosing water.
  High levels of Hardness can be a problem for aesthetics mainly, and it is common to use water with moderate levels of Hardness.
  Moderate Hardness can be from 60 to 120 ppm.
  
Color:
  Color of sample: ()
  The color of this water sample could mean that it can contain ().
  
  Color in water is not always a bad sign but it can represent different minerals in a water sample.
  In pipes that are made out of iron and lead rust can pollute the water and create changes in color.
  Please note that the color of the water does not exactly mean that the water is polluted, but it should
  be taken into consideration.

Location:
  Location of sample: ()
  The location that this water sample was collected in has(n't) had (any) previous issues with water pollution or safety.
  Water from this area has been common to have (none or undectable) (contaminates listed) types of contaminates in it and
  should be taken into account when deciding whether the water is safe to use.
  
Report:
  From the information given on this water sample it is (safe/unsafe/unsure) (to drink/if it is safe).
  
  Professional testing may be beneficial as a water test such as this is not always reliable and there are sometimes hidden
  dangers that can happen. For consumer use this may be all that is needed.
