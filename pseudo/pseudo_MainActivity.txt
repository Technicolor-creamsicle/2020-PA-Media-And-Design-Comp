  The text box is assigned to the one on the main screen
  The buttons are assigned to the buttons on the main screen
  
  A string (num) is created and set to be blank
  The string is set to the amount of samples in the sample list
  
  The text box is then set to display that string
  
  The 'samples' button is set to react when it is clicked: {
    when it is clicked, it will load the page that lists the samples.
    END
  }
  
  The 'newsample' button is set to react when it is clicked: {
