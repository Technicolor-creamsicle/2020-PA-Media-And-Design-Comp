This class is meant to create a new water sample
that can then be tested in the samples list.

START
Several 'strings' are initialized and are unnasigned
  They are called sampleName, sampleColor, and sampleLocation;
Several decimal numbers are initialized and are unnasigned
  They are called samplePH and samplePPM;
  
Several editable text boxes are initialized and are unnasigned
  They are called nameField, colorField, locationField, phField, and ppmField;
A normal text box is initialized and unnasigned;

A button is initialized and unnasigned.;

When the app is loaded it will do the following: {
   The screen will be set to the screen for making a new sample;
   
   The button will be assigned to the submit button on the new sample screen;
   
   All of the editable text boxes will be assigned to their respective text boxes on the new sample screen;
   
   The text box will assigned to the warning message text box on the new sample screen;
   It is then set to be invisible;
   
   The submit button is set to react when clicked:{
    A counter number is made and set to 0;
    
    IF: nameField text box was set to something
      set nameField to what was entered;
        OTHERWISE:
          do not change nameField and increase the counter by 1;
          
    IF: colorField text box was set to something
      set colorField to what was entered;
        OTHERWISE:
          do not change colorField and increase the counter by 1;
          
    IF: locationField text box was set to something
      set locationField to what was entered;
        OTHERWISE:
          do not change locationField and increase the counter by 1;
          
    IF: phField text box was set to something
      set phField to what was entered;
        OTHERWISE:
          do not change phField and increase the counter by 1;
          
    IF: ppmField text box was set to something
      set ppmField to what was entered;
        OTHERWISE:
          do not change ppmField and increase the counter by 1;
          
    IF: the counter is still at 0 {
      Create a new 'WaterSample' object and set its contents to what was entered in the text boxes.;
      Create a new 'DataCreation' object to add the new sample.
      
      Use the newsample function that DataCreation has to make the WaterSample;
      
      Load the main screen again to leave the NewSample screen
    }
    
    IF: the counter is above 0
      set the warning text box to be visible;
      
   END
